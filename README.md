# COVID-19_RealTimeModeling

This project is focused on real time COVID-19 modeling in the Hungarian (can be any country where public data is avalible) population. 

Effective reproduction number estimation with Wallinga and Teunis / Cori methods.

Different SIR and SEIR model implementations for different scenarios.

I also visualize the results in R. plots.
